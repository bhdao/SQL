# COVID Data Study

Handling this data has helped me understand the impact of COVID on the world more. I can better understand the toll of just a single digit percentage death rate during the pandemic, the places with the most COVID cases and the degree to which those populations are affected.

I followed a tutorial by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTheAnalyst">Alex the Analyst</a> on Youtube for breaking down and using COVID data.

Thank you Alex! I then went on to apply what I've learned here and did my own study based on one of my interests regarding <a href="https://github.com/bhdao/SQL/tree/main/NINTENDO%20SALES">Nintendo Switch Sales</a>.
