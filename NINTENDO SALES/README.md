# Nintendo Switch Sales Data Study

This was a really fun dataset to work with. One measurement I’m considering taking next time is comparing the locations’ population sizes to their sales numbers. Originally, I naively guessed that the product is just more popular in the Americas based on its clear lead in sales numbers, but then I remembered— the population size is MUCH greater than that of Japan alone. I think this sales-to-population comparison would be more accurate in determining the popularity of the console.  

One thing that was strange was after adding up the total sales for hardware units, it did not come out to the 107.65M (where I calculated 104.94M). Regardless, in general the data seems to be believable, even with the missing ~3M units.
